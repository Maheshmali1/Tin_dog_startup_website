# Tin_dog_startup_website
Tinder for dogs. A startup website built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap only!!

Technologies used : 

- Here I built an startup website for the tinder app for dogs. 
- Used the basic HTML alongside the various bootstrap classes to style navbar, cards, carousel etc.
- Used the CSS and responsive web design which will work best for all screen sizes ( mobile, tablet and PC).
